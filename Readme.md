Drawing robot
=============

This project uses an arduino, some servo motors and a pen to draw a picture like a human would do.

Don't expect anything to work properly here, its not ready for release yet.

The `arduino` folder contains the sketch to run on the arduino. The `companion` folder contains some python scripts to do image processing and calculate the movement of the robot arm.
