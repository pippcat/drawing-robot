Drawing robot
=============

This project uses an arduino or raspberrypi, some servo motors and a pen to draw a picture like a human would do.

Don't expect anything to work properly here, its not ready for release yet. Although you might want to try the simulator by invocing `/companion/companion.py`. You have to put the image into the `/companion/images` subfolder.

The `arduino` folder contains the sketch to run on the arduino. The `companion` folder contains some python scripts to do image processing and calculate the movement of the robot arm.
