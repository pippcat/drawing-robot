# Installation on raspbian and debian

You can install the software to try out the simulator and image processing without having a real robot to control it with. The installation routine slightly differs, which is noted in the steps below:

1. Install software via debian package manager:
 - `apt install git python3-pip`
 - if you're installing it on a RasPi and do want to control a real robot:
 - `apt install python3-rpi.gpio`
2. Install software via python package manager:
 - `pip3 install bokeh pandas matplotlib scikit-image`
